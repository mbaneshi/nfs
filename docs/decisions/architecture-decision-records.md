## ADR-002: Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need scalable, maintainable architecture that can grow from startup to enterprise

### Decision
Implement Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns:
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, entities, value objects, domain services
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, commands, queries, handlers (CQRS)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns, repositories, event bus
- **Presentation Layer**: API routes, middleware, dependency injection

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has specific responsibilities
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test business logic in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Scalability**: Can extract microservices when needed
- **Team Productivity**: Clear boundaries for team members

### Consequences
- ✅ Highly maintainable and testable code
- ✅ Business logic independent of frameworks
- ✅ Easy to add new features without breaking existing code
- ✅ Clear development patterns for team members
- ⚠️ Initial complexity higher than simple CRUD
- ⚠️ Requires team understanding of DDD concepts

## ADR-003: CQRS Pattern Implementation

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to optimize read and write operations, prepare for scaling

### Decision
Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):
- **Commands**: Write operations (Create, Update, Delete)
- **Queries**: Read operations (Get, List, Search)
- **Command Handlers**: Process write operations
- **Query Handlers**: Process read operations
- **Application Services**: Orchestrate handlers

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Optimize read and write operations independently
- **Scalability**: Can scale read and write sides separately
- **Complexity Management**: Separate concerns for complex business logic
- **Future-Proofing**: Easy to add caching, event sourcing later

### Consequences
- ✅ Optimized performance for read/write operations
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easy to add caching and optimization
- ✅ Scalable architecture

- **n8n Integration**: Trigger workflows on domain events

### Rationale
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through events
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing
- **AI Automation**: Natural fit for triggering AI workflows
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new event handlers

### Consequences
- ✅ Highly scalable and loosely coupled
- ✅ Perfect for AI automation workflows
- ✅ Easy to add new integrations
- ✅ Asynchronous processing
- ⚠️ Eventual consistency challenges

## ADR-005: Supabase Integration Strategy

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to integrate Supabase with FastAPI backend

### Decision
Use "Supabase-Centric with Hybrid Elements" approach:
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT validation in FastAPI
- **Database**: Direct PostgreSQL connection + Supabase client for simple operations
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for live updates
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for file uploads
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions for serverless operations

### Rationale
- **Rapid Development**: Leverage Supabase's built-in features
- **Flexibility**: Direct database access for complex queries
- **Real-time**: Built-in real-time capabilities
- **Cost-Effective**: Supabase's generous free tier

### Consequences
- ✅ Rapid development with Supabase features
- ✅ Real-time capabilities out of the box
- ✅ Flexible database access
- ✅ Built-in authentication
- ⚠️ Vendor lock-in concerns
- ⚠️ Learning curve for Supabase-specific features

## ADR-006: n8n Integration Strategy

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to integrate self-hosted n8n with FastAPI backend

### Decision
Use "Webhook + API" integration pattern:
- **Webhooks**: FastAPI exposes webhook endpoints for n8n triggers
- **API Calls**: FastAPI calls n8n API for workflow execution
- **Event Triggers**: Domain events trigger n8n workflows
- **Workflow Management**: CRUD operations for n8n workflows

### Rationale
- **Bidirectional**: Both systems can trigger each other
- **Event-Driven**: Natural fit with our event architecture
